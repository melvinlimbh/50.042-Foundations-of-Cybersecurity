Q1. We only need to exchange results of g^a(resp. b) mod p, and channel do not need to be secure. Thus we can use
    a key server or any communication platforms. This is due to having many unknowns for the attacker to brute force,
    it is difficult for the attacker to find out g,a,b,p as all of them can be random from a one-way function.

Q2. Advantage : both parties do not need any prior knowledge other than the public key that was exchanged,
    making it fast and simple.

    Disadvantage : Does not work on any asymmetric key exchanges  


Q3.  At least 2048 bits, the time and space complexity of babygiant is O(2^(n/2)), and it would take up 
     a lot of memory to store the different key values for comparison. For a 2048-bit prime number,
     the memory of computers would be overloaded and program will crash.
